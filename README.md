# brainwords
*work in progress*

**Description**

A python program with kivy UI that lets you write poetry via EEG. The program suggests words to the user which can be added to the poem. 
If the user concentrates while a word is shown, it's added to the poem. If the user meditates or if the state of mind is indifferent, the current word will be discarded.

The code is based on the [project illithid](https://github.com/crystoll/projectillithid) which is used to read the data from the Neurosky Mindwave headset.
